Overview: The Spotify Dashboard project aims to create a dynamic and interactive user interface for displaying my personalized Spotify data for the last 6 years(2019-2025). The dashboard pulls information from my Spotify data(JSON files) to showcase real-time user statistics such as top tracks, favorite artists, listening history, song end reason and in which part of the day I listened the most. The interface is designed to provide a user-friendly experience while offering in-depth insights into my music preferences and activity.

Key Insights:

Listening Trends Over Time:

Peak in 2022: The "Songs per Year" graph shows a clear peak in listening activity in 2022. This could be due to various factors like more free time, specific events, or simply a period of heightened music discovery.

Decline After Peak: There's a noticeable decline in listening after 2022, though there's a slight uptick towards 2024.
Top Content:

Top Songs: "Hold On" is the most played song with 154 plays, followed by "Can't Let You Go" (122 plays). This highlights my favorite tracks.

Top Artists: Pritam is the most listened-to artist by a significant margin (756 plays), followed by Amit Trivedi (641 plays) and Justin Bieber (533 plays). This suggests a strong preference for these artists.

Song End Reasons:

"Trackdone" (song finished playing) is the most common reason for a song ending (40.94%), which is normal.

"Fwdbtn" (forward button) accounts for a substantial portion (21.77%), "Endplay" (I played another song) makes up 20.68%. and "Backbtn" (backward button) accounts for (6.91%)and indicating that I frequently skips songs. This could mean I may be exploring new music, not enjoying certain parts of songs, or using playlists with some unwanted tracks.
